# Resume Description: Distributed Consensus System Simulator

## Short Resume Description
Designed and implemented a real-time distributed system simulator visualizing the Raft consensus algorithm with interactive fault simulation, providing insights into leader election, network partitioning, and fault tolerance in distributed systems.

## Detailed Resume Description
**Distributed Consensus System Simulator**
- Engineered a real-time distributed system simulator that visualizes the Raft consensus algorithm with an interactive GUI
- Implemented multi-threaded architecture to simulate concurrent, independent nodes in a distributed network
- Designed message-passing infrastructure with network partition simulation and node failure recovery
- Created a real-time visualization system to display state changes, leader election, and message flow between nodes
- Implemented interactive controls for fault injection, demonstrating resilience in distributed systems
- Demonstrated advanced knowledge of distributed systems concepts including leader election, heartbeat mechanisms, term-based consensus, and split-brain resolution
