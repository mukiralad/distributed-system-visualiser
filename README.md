# Distributed System Simulation

A visualization and simulation of a simplified Raft consensus algorithm.

## Overview
This project simulates a distributed system with multiple nodes running a consensus protocol based on Raft. 
It demonstrates concepts such as leader election, log replication, and fault tolerance in distributed systems.

## Features
- Multiple node simulation with state visualization
- Leader election algorithm
- Interactive node failure simulation
- Network partition simulation
- Real-time message passing visualization

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Tkinter (for visualization)
- Pillow (for image processing)

## Usage
Run the main simulation:
```
python src/main.py
```
